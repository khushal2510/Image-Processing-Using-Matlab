# Image-Processing-Using-Matlab
Image Processing is a technique to find the visionary elements/components present in the particular image.
Using image processing we can convert any image into its corrresponding binary image,complement image,grayscale image and also we can detects the edges using Edge canny Detection Method.
This project is divided into 2 types as i) Image Processing using Matlab code directly. ii) And by using Matlab GUI Programming language.
Matlab GUI Programming provides various functions which can be used to create or simulate the app ,after that one can callback all the commands under particular button function name.
It is a project created for the Second Year Engineering Project Based Learning under the Department of Instrumentation and Control.
